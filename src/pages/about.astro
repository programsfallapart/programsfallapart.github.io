        <p>Hey there 👋, I’m Amira (ah-mee-rah) .</p>
        <p>
          I started off in mathematics, but somewhere along the way, I stumbled
          into software engineering and just… stayed. There's something about
          solving tricky software problems that keeps pulling me back in 💻.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m not here to claim mastery over anything. I’m just a curious
          programmer with a skeptical mind 🧠. This blog comes from those
          nights, you know, when a "quick fix" spirals into a three-hour deep
          dive on why programming languages handle whitespace differently, all
          while a forgotten coffee cup grows cold beside you ☕️. That's where
          most of these posts come from.<br />
        </p>

        <p>
          What you'll find here are thoughts from those rabbit holes. Technical
          insights that are a bit opinionated and hopefully useful.<br />
        </p>

        <p>
          So, this is a space for learning, not to be taken too seriously 😄.
          I’m here to share the journey, probably mess up a few times, and maybe
          even spark some real conversations. If you ever feel like reaching
          out, I’m just a comment, an <a

            >twitter</a
